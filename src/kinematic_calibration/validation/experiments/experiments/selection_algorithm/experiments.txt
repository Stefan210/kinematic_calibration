\section{Pose Selection Algorithm}
\label{sec:pose_selection_algorithm}

\subsection{Motivation}
In \ref{sec:selection_algorithm}, we presented two algorithms for the selection of poses which maximize the observability index. Further, we developed a new algorithm which extended \emph{Exchange-Add-Exchange} algorithm. In this experiment, we compare the \emph{Exchange-Add-Exchange} algorithm to our new algorithm.

\subsection{Setup}
We used the same setup as in \ref{sec:poses_and_measurements}, i.e. we selected poses out of two thirds of the 750 measurements respectively (which is needed for 3-fold cross-validation). In order to compare both algorithms, we selected 50 measurements for each fold.
